#Sites Used for Inspiration

##Hemingway App
[hemingwayapp.com](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
This site has two text input user interfaces: writing and editing. In the writing interface, you write like you would in a normal text editor. In the editing interface, sentences that are too complex, sentences that are too long, adverbs, common errors, etc. are highlighted and revision suggestions are available.

I want to take inspiration from this text editor design because it feels more like a typewriter or writing on paper while having the functionality of a WYSIWYG editor online. It's distraction-free writing.

For UX design, I want to emulate the feedback in realtime aspect. The right sidebar shows how much you need to fix without being distracting.

Make it look like paper. Make it look longform. Make it good.

##Duolingo & Headspace

[headspace.com](headspace.com)
I'm taking inspiration from both of these with only slight differences in my reasoning. Both Duolingo and Headspace automatically generate your stats, send you reminders, and show progress visually in a satifying way (dot map). Each of them create goals that are manageable and give feedback the entire way.

**Duolingo**
Specifically from Duolingo I want to take the social aspect. Inviting friends to join you and seeing their progress is a serious strength this app has. You can also get badges and lingots as rewards, making continued use of the app more fun and rewarding.

**Headspace**
Headspace's animation make the onboarding process a really enlightening teaching process, demystifying the practice of meditation and making it feel manageable. I'd love to create content that helps people learn and get into a good habit of writing every day -- a starter pack of sorts. Or a package of challenges.

##Medium

This utter emptiness of the UI is breathtaking. I love it. No bullshit, just everything you need and your words. The social aspect and indexing of work others have penned is also easy to digest, with the content staying at a width that's easy to read fast. The keyboard shortcuts that display your first few times get you used to the text editor, but go away after you're used to it. The dot and menu are super simple and a great way to hide tools that aren't always vital. Mobile tool bar is just as awesome.

Whitespace. Such good use of white space.

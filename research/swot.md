#SWOT Analysis
Based on my research, I can see an untapped market of young writers that my app could fulfill. While there are many writing prompt apps out there, none of them are particularly attractive for young writers. By creating something that has the features, design, and usability an 18 - 26 y/o aspiring writer wants, this writing prompt app can become a go-to writing tool for this group.

##Strengths
- Highly-targeted market (18 - 26 y/o writers who use apps to teach themselves new skills 5-10 minutes at a time)
- Clean, minimalist design.
- Social/Community features that other apps don't have but users do want
- Educational content/themed writing challenges and filters
- Ability for user to write in app and create user account (other apps don't do this)

##Weaknesses
- Unknown in a market where the leaders have been the leaders for 10+ years
- Few prompts compared with the thousands that the leaders have
- No deals or established partnerships with influencers
- No users
- No funding

##Opportunities
- Create partnerships with established writing blogs and communities of writers
- Create features that the users want and showcase those
- Create a design that resonates with writers (the current leaders have dated design that doesn't provide a good UX)
- Help users create content that they want to share and get organic social media love
- Create high-quality instructional content that actually makes users better writers

##Threats
- A well-funded company creating a similar product
- A mobile and web company creating a cross-platform company
- An established generator/writing tool redesigning and adding features
- A hacker stealing user data
- People using the app for plagiarism

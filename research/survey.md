##Question
Hey wanted to get your feedback: I'm building a writing prompt generator web app for my final project. The idea is to get people writing a little bit every day to get better and practice writing about different things.

If you were using an app like this, what would you want to be able to do with it?


##Answers

I would want to be able to read old stories that I’ve already written, see what other people wrote with the same prompt, and be able to vote for which stories I like - Nate H

More than anything, I'd want the prompts to be good. Maybe a word limit like 100- to 200-words - Katy K

Save whatever I wrote from the prompt as a .doc .pdf or .pages file and be able to easily export it in case I had a great brainstorm or something. Be able to share what I wrote on social media. Like one of those "I just shared my thoughts on "writing prompt subject" through "writing prompt app" - check it out! maybe a "helpful hints or tips" section where other writers / app users could give advice or talk? - Danya P

Have fast links to databases or have a large database in it to be able to do research quickly and just insert my notes on it. Or have like..top stories/random poetry on the front page to inspire you. Like, showcasing different styles and then it says, "try it out" and you click and then bam. You have a document with guidelines on how to write in the style and a list of exemplars - Derek P

it’d be cool if you could track your progress over a period of time - Jen U

Hm. Ok. I guess probably word association, random word and picture generation, different filters to write through (like trying to write about situations in my life the way Hemingway or someone would've written about it), passages to respond to, diary type stuff but in terms I wouldn't use on my own - Lexi J

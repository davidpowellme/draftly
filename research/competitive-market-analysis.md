###Seventh Sanctum
This is a website devoted to random generators "from story concepts to science fiction weapons to extremely silly spells". It's not strictly-speaking for writers. The design looks like an early 2000s website, which shows their age. It's ultra-functional and well-established, but it's ugly as sin and not focused.

**Strengths**
- This generator has lots of options, and it has several categories and sub-categories
- It's ranking well in Google
- It's had a long time to compile items
- Regularly updated blog

**Weakenesses**
- Site feels cramped, so much content and text-heavy content not organized with high degree of usability
- No clear calls to action
- No happy path apparent
- Site lacks focus
- Site design generic and dated (looks like if Facebook or Reddit was designed in 1999)

###Writing Exercises UK
This site is very basic, easy to use, and clear. It has some whimsy (lottery generator, changing style sheets and content for kids), but overall is functional and something built by a developer, not a designer. It feels very educational and seems like a place that would house writing exercises -- it's like a teacher, or a site a teacher would make. There's clear hierarchy but it's not differentiated like you expect -- only button is the generate button. Older design, but regularly updated site (explains Google).

For usability and thought put into making this site so freaking complete, it's an A+ and I'll use it as inspiration for my UX design. However, the UI is weak.

**Strengths**
- TONS of categories/generator options
- Explain each prompt-type purpose before the generation
- A really focused, complete site
- Regularly updated
- High degree of usability
- Great Google ranking
- Bits of whimsy
- Customization (kids versus all)
- Feedback
- Holy shit the plot thing is awesome.

**Weaknesses**
- Design hierarchy isn't what users of other sites would expect
- Old, old, old school design
- No ability to create account
- Nothing social about it
- Elements need more structure
- Doesn't look like an app: Looks like an old school blog

###Adam Maxwell's Fiction Lounge
This is only a super small spot on the main website for this author. It's part of the section "Lost the Plot?" which includes a Character Name generator and Plot generator (which is really a first line of a story generator). It's more of an inspiration thing than it is an exercise thing. It's also admittedly not finished, so maybe it'll get better.

**Strengths**
- Being on semi-famous author's site
- High-quality first lines
- Site is sort of cool (highly custom)

**Weakeness**
- It's very basic and not super useful
- It's not easy enough to use that anyone is going to quick reference it unless they really love this author
- It doesn't even say if the author wrote all of these on the page
- You can't write in the app
- You can't see anyone else using the app
- It's really just a single serving thing that can't compete

###Scholastic Story Starters
This is a site for kids, and it acts like a site for kids. It's using flash and it pretty cool if you liked online games on Cartoon network circa 2002. Not. My. Crowd.

It's got different categories and is awesome for the market it serves, I'm sure.

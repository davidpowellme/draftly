###Seventh Sanctum
This is a website devoted to random generators "from story concepts to science fiction weapons to extremely silly spells". It's not strictly-speaking for writers. The design looks like an early 2000s website, which shows their age. It's ultra-functional and well-established, but it's ugly as sin and not focused.

**Strengths**
- This generator has lots of options, and it has several categories and sub-categories
- It's ranking well in Google
- It's had a long time to compile items
- Regularly updated blog

**Weakenesses**
- Site feels cramped, so much content and text-heavy content not organized with high degree of usability
- No clear calls to action
- No happy path apparent
- Site lacks focus
- Site design generic and dated (looks like if Facebook or Reddit was designed in 1999)

###Writing Exercises UK
This site is very basic, easy to use, and clear. It has some whimsy (lottery generator, changing style sheets and content for kids), but overall is functional and something built by a developer, not a designer. It feels very educational and seems like a place that would house writing exercises -- it's like a teacher, or a site a teacher would make. There's clear hierarchy but it's not differentiated like you expect -- only button is the generate button. Older design, but regularly updated site (explains Google).

For usability and thought put into making this site so freaking complete, it's an A+ and I'll use it as inspiration for my UX design. However, the UI is weak.

**Strengths**
- TONS of categories/generator options
- Explain each prompt-type purpose before the generation
- A really focused, complete site
- Regularly updated
- High degree of usability
- Great Google ranking
- Bits of whimsy
- Customization (kids versus all)
- Feedback
- Holy shit the plot thing is awesome.

**Weaknesses**
- Design hierarchy isn't what users of other sites would expect
- Old, old, old school design
- No ability to create account
- Nothing social about it
- Elements need more structure
- Doesn't look like an app: Looks like an old school blog

###Adam Maxwell's Fiction Lounge
This is only a super small spot on the main website for this author. It's part of the section "Lost the Plot?" which includes a Character Name generator and Plot generator (which is really a first line of a story generator). It's more of an inspiration thing than it is an exercise thing. It's also admittedly not finished, so maybe it'll get better.

**Strengths**
- Being on semi-famous author's site
- High-quality first lines
- Site is sort of cool (highly custom)

**Weakeness**
- It's very basic and not super useful
- It's not easy enough to use that anyone is going to quick reference it unless they really love this author
- It doesn't even say if the author wrote all of these on the page
- You can't write in the app
- You can't see anyone else using the app
- It's really just a single serving thing that can't compete

###Scholastic Story Starters
This is a site for kids, and it acts like a site for kids. It's using flash and it pretty cool if you liked online games on Cartoon network circa 2002. Not. My. Crowd.

It's got different categories and is awesome for the market it serves, I'm sure.

##Mobile Apps
1. [Prompts App](http://getprompts.com/) by Tanner Christensen
2. Brainsparker

###Prompts
This is what my MVP would be: An app that gives you a prompt, gives you a place to start writing, allows you to share/save your work, archives and tracks your progress.

It's ultra simple, ultra light, and more of a first line generator than a prompt generator. Good practice and has push notifications, though. Worth $3, but not more. No social aspect, bare minimum app. Even though the focus is on content, it feels gray heavy, and instead of being reminiscient of a newspaper or b/w film or pages of a book, it feels cold and industrial. Even though you can technically share it, it basically exists in a vacuum. Cool, functional concept, though.

**Strengths**
- Fully functional, easy to use
- Does what it says it does, and does it well
- Automatic stats tracking
- Automatic reminders
- Clean design
- Native app, great for mobile

**Weaknesses**
- No social aspect
- Not linked to many places
- No web app counterpart
- No seamless way to make longform
- Exists in a vacuum, needs community or more feedback

###Brainsparker
Brainsparker is a "creativity generator" not a strictly writing generator. Writing is an aspect of it, sure, but the community is more self-improvement and creatives-based than it is writing-focused. They have a community and are building an awesome, highly-automated creativity coaching business.

Not really social, but it looks like the beginning of a community and that the service will be more social soon.

The Academy workouts on the website is very much a "workout your creativity" thing, and I think I could take something from that. They're really going more for the _exercises_ over the _inspiration_ and I think they've tapped into something useful. The printouts are great for creatives, especially for the ones that like to have something tangible -- another thing I should steal.

**Strengths**
- Strong marketing site
- downloadables
- Lots of card packs to buy and customize
- Modern design that feels like something "creatives" would normally use
- Interactive and creative UX (shake to sort cards instead of tapping to generate)
- Quotes, ideas, etc.

**Weaknesses**
- Still feels like it's growing from an inspiration app to a sort of "creativity workout"
- It's not something that you can really _use_ but more just a "look at this" sort of thing
- Still exists in a vacuum, no measurable stats for doing "workouts", nothing social, no community

This project is a freewriting app with a random prompt generator and social network features. It's the writing equivalent of Duolingo or Headspace.

##Target Market
The target user is a 18 - 30 y/o and uses apps to learn and practice new skills 5-10 minutes at a time.

##Problem
While many writing prompt generators exist, they don't work across all devices, most don't have a feature that allows the user to write within the app, none of them have goal-setting or level features, they exist in a vacuum (no social or community features).

##Client
In this case, I am the client. I'm building this project as a passion project, but the investment and any return on investment will be entirely mine. I'm the primary stakeholder and designing for myself (unless someone comes along to back this project -- where you at investors?).
